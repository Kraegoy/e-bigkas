# e-BIGKAS

## Overview
This project aims to create a platform for detecting basic Filipino sign language words using TensorFlow, MediaPipe, RNN, 
and other relevant technologies. It provides video call functionality, catering to the needs of the deaf community and their 
loved ones who may not understand Filipino sign language. The project is developed as a part of our thesis 
and for the "Friendship of Enjoy" community.
